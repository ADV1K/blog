This is not my first attempt at starting a blog (not even the second). Honestly, I've lost count of how many times I thought of starting a blog, and then got lost configuring the theme but never got around to actually writing something, anything.

Being able to express your thoughts into words is an important skill, and to do that you need to write more.

So here I am, writing my first ever blog post. This is more of a note to self, rather than for you to read.
 
I, Advik, commit to myself that from this point forward, I will write more.
